<br>
<br>Unless stated otherwise below, the provision of your personal data is neither legally nor contractually obligatory, nor required for conclusion of a contract. You are not obliged to provide your data. Not providing it will have no consequences. This only applies as long as the processing procedures below do not state otherwise.

<br>
<br>You can use our websites without submitting personal data.  
<br>
<br>Every time our website is accessed, user data is transferred to us or our web hosts/IT service providers by your internet browser and stored in server log files. This stored data includes for example the name of the site called up, date and time of the request, the IP address, amount of data transferred and the provider making the request. The processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1) f) GDPR due to our legitimate interests in ensuring the smooth operation of our website as well as improving our services.

<br>If the initial contact serves to implement pre-contractual measures (e.g. consultation in the case of purchase interest, order creation) or concerns an agreement already concluded between you and us, this data processing takes place on the basis of Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. 
<br>
<br>If the initial contact occurs for other reasons, this data processing takes place on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the purposes of our overriding, legitimate interest in handling and responding to your request. In this case, on grounds relating to your particular situation, you have the right to object at any time to this processing of personal data concerning you and carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. 
<br>
<br>We will only use your email address to process your request. Your data will subsequently be deleted in compliance with statutory retention periods, unless you have agreed to further processing and use.

<br>Use of the Google Analytics
<br>
<br>Our website uses the web analysis service Google Analytics from Google LLC. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google"). If you are ordinarily resident in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) is the controller responsible for your data. Google Ireland Limited is therefore the company affiliated with Google responsible for processing your data and for compliance with the applicable data protection legislation. The processing of data serves to analyse this website and its visitors and for marketing and advertising purposes.
<br>
<br>Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide other services to the website operator relating to website and internet use. In this process the following information, inter alia, can be collected: IP address, date and time of the website access, click path, information on the browser and the device you are using, the pages visited, referrer URL (website via which you accessed our website), location data, purchasing activities. The IP address transmitted from your browser within the scope of Google Analytics is not associated with any other data held by Google.
<br>
<br>Google Analytics uses technology such as cookies, web storage in the browser and tracking pixels which enable an analysis of your use of the website. The information generated by these regarding your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. IP anonymisation is activated on this website. Google uses this to shorten your IP address beforehand within Member States of the European Union or in other signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and shortened there.

<br>Use of Microsoft Teams
<br>
<br>For the execution of our online seminars/courses (hereinafter referred to as: online seminars) within the framework of an agreement for the processing of orders, we use the video conferencing tool Microsoft Teams from the Microsoft Corporation (One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA; "Microsoft").
<br>
<br>You can participate in our online seminars via the Microsoft Teams app (after downloading it from the provider's website) or via the browser version on the provider's website.

The provision of this data is necessary for the fulfilment of the agreement concluded between you and us for the provision of the online seminar. Failure to provide this data means that you cannot participate in our online seminar.
<br>
<br>Furthermore, we collect and process text entries made by you during the online seminar as well as video and audio transmissions of your device. You can deactivate your camera and microphone before entering the online seminar and at any time during the online seminar. In this case, no data will be recorded. If you do not want to provide data via the chat, camera or audio function, you will not be able to actively participate in the online seminar or communicate with other participants.
<br>
<br>If we record our online seminars for follow-up purposes, in particular for subsequent provision to the respective participants, you will be informed separately before the start of the online seminar. You will also recognise a recording by the identification during the online seminar. During a recording, your display name, any text entries made in the chat as well as video/audio transmissions of your device will be saved and, if necessary, subsequently transmitted to the respective participants of the online seminar.
<br>
<br>The data collected during the execution of our online seminars is transmitted to Microsoft and thus to the USA within the framework of the order processing contract. 
<br>
<br>The processing will occur on the basis of Article 6(1) b) GDPR and is required for the fulfilment of a contract with you.

<br>Plug-ins
<br>
<br>Use of the Google Tag Manager 
<br>
<br>Our website uses the Google Tag Manager from Google LLC. (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google"). If you are ordinarily resident in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) is the controller responsible for your data. Google Ireland Limited is therefore the company affiliated with Google responsible for processing your data and for compliance with the applicable data protection legislation. This application manages JavaScript tags and HTML tags which are used in particular to implement tracking and analysis tools. The data processing serves to facilitate the needs-based design and optimisation of our website. The Google Tag Manager itself neither stores cookies nor processes personal data. It does, however, enable the triggering of further tags which may collect and process personal data. You can find more detailed information on the terms and conditions of use and data protection at https://www.google.com/intl/de/tagmanager/use-policy.html (https://www.google.com/intl/de/tagmanager/use-policy.html)
<br>
<br>Use of social plug-ins 
<br>
<br>Our website uses social network plug-ins. The integration of social plug-ins and the data processing associated with this serves the purpose of optimising the advertising for our products.
<br>
<br>The integration of social plug-ins involves a connection between your computer and the servers of the service provider of the social network which then instructs your web browser to display the plug-in on that web page, provided you have expressly consented to this. In this process, both your IP address as well as the information on which web pages you have visited will be transmitted to the provider's servers. This happens regardless of whether you are registered with or logged into the social network. The information is transferred even if users are not registered or logged in. Should you be connected simultaneously with one or more of your social network accounts, the collected information may also be assigned to your corresponding profiles. When using the plug-in functions (e.g. by pressing the appropriate button), this information will also be assigned to your user account. You can therefore prevent this assignment by logging yourself out before visiting our website and before activating the button for your social media accounts.
<br>
<br>The processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR with your consent. You can withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the legality of the processing carried out with your consent up to the withdrawal. The following social networks are integrated in our website through social plug-ins. You can find more detailed information on the scope and purpose of collection and use of the data and your associated rights and options for protecting your privacy in the provider's privacy policy via the link.

<br>Use of Facebook Connect
<br>
<br>Our website uses the single sign-on function Facebook Connect from Facebook Ireland Ltd. (Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin, D02, Ireland; "Facebook").
<br>
<br>This function enables website visitors to log on to the website via their already existing Facebook account. The processing of data serves the purpose of verification during registration, personalisation and for interest-related advertising. To offer this function on the website a connection to the Facebook servers is established. Cookies are used for this purpose. In this process the following information, inter alia, can be collected and transmitted to Facebook: IP address, browser information, referrer URL (website via which you accessed our website), location data. This happens regardless of whether you are registered with or logged into the social network. The information is transferred even if users are not registered or logged in. Should you be connected simultaneously with one or more of your social network accounts, the collected information may also be assigned to your corresponding profiles. You can therefore prevent this assignment by logging yourself out before visiting our website and before activating the button for your social media accounts. Your data may be transmitted to the USA.
<br>
<br>When using the single sign-on function the Facebook profile of the website visitor is connected with a customer account for this website. In this case we receive personal data of the user through Facebook, as stated in the login process. This can include the following information, inter alia: Name, address, public profile information (e,g, name profile picture, age, gender), email address, friends list, "Likes" information. The data processing, particularly the placing of cookies, is carried out with your consent on the basis of Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. You can withdraw your consent at any time without affecting the legality of the processing carried out with your consent up to the withdrawal.
<br>

<br>Use of Google reCAPTCHA  
<br>
<br>Our website uses the reCAPTCHA service by Google LLC (1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google"). 
<br>
<br>Google Ireland Limited (Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland) is the data controller responsible for your data if you have your habitual residence in the European Economic Area or Switzerland. Google Ireland Limited is therefore the company affiliated with Google which is responsible for processing your data and for compliance with applicable data protection laws.
<br>
<br>The request serves to distinguish whether the input was made by a human or automatic machine processing. For this purpose your input will be transmitted to Google and used by them further. In addition, the IP address and any other data required by Google for the reCAPTCHA service will be transferred to Google. This data will be processed by Google within the EU and potentially also in the USA.  
<br>
<br>Processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)f) GDPR due to our legitimate interest in protecting our website from automated spying, misuse and SPAM. On grounds relating to your particular situation, you have the right to object at any time to this processing of personal data concerning you and carried out in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. 
<br>

<br>This can involve the collection of, among other things, the following information: IP address, system configuration information, information about the traffic from and to customer websites (server log files). 
<br>
<br>Your data may be transmitted to the USA.  
<br>
<br>Processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR for the purposes of our legitimate interest in needs-based and targeted design of the website.

<br>
<br>Further information on the data collected and used by Google, your rights and privacy can be found in Google's privacy policy at https://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html (https://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). You also have the option of changing your settings in the data protection centre, allowing you to administer and protect the data processed by Google.
<br>
<br>Using Vimeo
<br>
<br>Our website uses plug-ins from Vimeo Inc. (555 West 18th Street New York, New York 10011, USA; "Vimeo") to integrate videos into the "Vimeo" portal.
<br>
<br>If you access pages on our website that contain this kind of plug-in, this will generate a connection to the Vimeo server and indicate the plug-in on the site by means of a message in your browser. Information such as your IP address and which websites you have visited will be transmitted to the Vimeo server.
<br>
<br>If you are logged into Vimeo, Vimeo will assign this information to your personal user account. When using the plug-in functions (e.g. starting a video by pressing the appropriate button), this information will also be assigned to your Vimeo account.
<br>
<br>Your data may be transmitted to the USA. 
<br>
<br>The data processing is carried out on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR due to our legitimate interest in the needs-based and targeted design of the website and the legitimate interest of Vimeo in market analysis and improving its services appropriately and in a targeted manner. On grounds relating to your particular situation, you have the right to object at any time to this processing of personal data concerning you and carried out in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR.
<br>
<br>If you would not like Vimeo to directly assign the information collected to your Vimeo account, you must log out of Vimeo before you visit our site.
<br>
<br>Further information on the purpose and scope of enquiry and continued use and processing of the data by Vimeo and your associated rights and options for protecting your privacy can be found in the Vimeo data privacy policy: https://vimeo.com/privacy (https://vimeo.com/privacy)
